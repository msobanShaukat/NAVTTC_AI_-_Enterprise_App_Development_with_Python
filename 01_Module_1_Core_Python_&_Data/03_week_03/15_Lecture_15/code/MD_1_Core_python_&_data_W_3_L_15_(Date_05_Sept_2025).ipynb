        "\n",
        "### üéØ What We Learned Today:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **SQL JOIN Types:**\n",
        "    - INNER JOIN: Finds matches between tables\n",
        "    - LEFT JOIN: Shows all records from left table + matches from right\n",
        "    - RIGHT JOIN: Shows all records from right table + matches from left  \n",
        "    - FULL JOIN: Shows all records from both tables\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Aggregation:**\n",
        "    - GROUP BY: Groups rows for summary calculations\n",
        "    - HAVING: Filters grouped results\n",
        "    - Aggregate functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Practical Applications:**\n",
        "    - Combining data from multiple tables\n",
        "    - Finding missing data (inactive suppliers, orphan products)\n",
        "    - Generating summary reports\n",
        "    - Data quality auditing\n",
        "\n",
        "### üîë Key SQL Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Join Type | SQL Syntax | Purpose |\n",
        "|:----------|:-----------|:--------|\n",
        "| INNER JOIN | `SELECT ... FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id` | Find matching records |\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Use aliases** for better readability\n",
        "2.  **Test joins** with small datasets first\n",
        "3.  **Be careful with NULL values** in outer joins\n",
        "4.  **Use WHERE for row filtering**, HAVING for group filtering\n",
